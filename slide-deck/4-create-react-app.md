## Cloud Storage UI

This is a demo application that will allow us to upload files to a cloud storage bucket.

Once files are uploaded, the UI will allow us to view, download, and delete files.

## Create react app

The UI was created using `create-react-app`.

```
npx create-react-app cloud-storage-ui
```

## npx

**npx** is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+

npx installs a temporary create-react-app and calls it, without polluting global installs
