## What is a Signed URL?

- A signed URL provides limited permission and time to make a request.
- Signed URLs contain authentication information in their query string, allowing users without credentials to perform specific actions on a resource.
- When you generate a signed URL, you specify a user or service account which must have sufficient permission to make the request that the signed URL will make.
- After you generate a signed URL, anyone who possesses it can use the signed URL to perform specified actions, such as reading an object, within a specified period of time.
